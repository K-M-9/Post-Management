## Techniques ðŸ› 
- Android (Kotlin): Core platform and language for building the app.
- Gradle (AGP) & KSP: Build system managing dependencies and Kotlin Symbol Processing for annotation processing.
- SplashScreen API: Provides a native launch screen experience.
- Navigation Component and Safe Args.
- Paging 3: Manages loading data in pages for RecyclerView.
- Room: Local database.
- Architecture: MVVM with Clean Architecture
- Data Binding: Binds UI components in layouts to data sources in your app, reducing boilerplate code.  
- Retrofit & Gson Converter: Simplifies HTTP requests and JSON parsing for network operations.
- Hilt (Dagger): Dependency injection framework to provide and manage app-wide dependencies.
- kotlinx-coroutines (Android & Test): Asynchronous programming and structured concurrency, plus test helpers.
- Lifecycle Runtime & ViewModel KTX: Lifecycle-aware components and ViewModel support for UI data.
